This configuration file sets up a decoder for web3 applications and defines various rules for different severity levels of log messages. You can modify the rules and decoders based on your specific needs and the web3 applications you are monitoring.

Additionally, don't forget to integrate Wazuh with other components in your infrastructure, such as Elasticsearch for log storage and analysis, and Kibana for visualization and monitoring.
